# Image-Caption-Generator
A WebApp that Generates Caption for Images using CNN-RNN.

__Application Link:__ https://dev228-afk-image-caption-generator-app-c6ckdt.streamlitapp.com/

## Model
This Model consists of a CNN-RNN Layer, Which is made of Keras Sequential API. it's made of the following contents:
1. _CNN Encoder Model_: Pretrained CNN Model, which generates Features for Input and Training Images. as an Encoder, Transfer Learning based Xception model has been used with its pretrained weights.
2. _word Embedding Layer_: Converts Caption into Word Embedding Tokens. it takes the input/output dimension of the Vector (32,256).
3. _LSTM Decoder Model_: LSTM is used as Text Sequence Processing in Encoder-Decoder Architecture, Which takes Input-pair of the feature vector of image and Partial Caption and returns Predicted Caption for input Image

##### Overview of the Overall Model with its Dimension is shown below:
